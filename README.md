# react-listitem-grid

Utilities and components for responsive card grid layout.

Documenation is coming soon, in the meantime, [see the CodeSandbox for example
usage][codesandbox]. The following files specifically use this package:

- [hooks.js][] shows how to instantiate the `useCalculateLayout` hook to get
  the raw calculated values for you to work with directly.
- [FlexContainer.js][] shows how to use CSS flexbox based `<ul>` container and
  `<li>` item components.
- [GridContainer.js][] shows how to use CSS grid based `<ul>` and `<li>`
  components.
