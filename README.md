# react-listitem-grid

Utilities and components for responsive card grid layout.

Documenation is coming soon. In the meantime, this repo includes an example app
that demonstrates what the library does. You can either clone the repo and run
the example app locally, or [play with the example app at
CodeSandbox][codesandbox]. The following files specifically use this package:

- [hooks.js][] shows how to instantiate the `useCalculateLayout` hook to get
  the raw calculated values for you to work with directly.
- [FlexContainer.js][] shows how to use CSS flexbox based `<ul>` container and
  `<li>` item components.
- [GridContainer.js][] shows how to use CSS grid based `<ul>` and `<li>`
  components.
